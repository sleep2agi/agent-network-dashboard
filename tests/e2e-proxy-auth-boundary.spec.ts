// 07-31 通信龙 catch — proxy.ts:22 matcher was missing `/nodes/:path*`.
// A no-cookie GET to `/nodes/<alias>` returned 200 with the full 36KB
// page shell, while every other matcher entry correctly returned
// 307 → /login.
//
// What this test verifies — and doesn't:
//
// This spec proves the ROUTE GATE (proxy.ts) redirects no-cookie
// requests. It does NOT prove authentication: `request.cookies.has()`
// checks presence only, so any garbage cookie value passes the gate.
// Real authentication is in /api/hub which validates the token
// contents when the page tries to fetch. See proxy.ts top comment
// for the full framing.
//
// The class of bug caught here: a matcher-list slip letting a
// dynamic-child route bypass the "no cookie → /login" bounce and
// serve page bytes to a visitor who has no cookie at all. Today
// /nodes/[alias] doesn't do a server-side data fetch (通信龙
// confirmed with a nonexistent alias — 200 + 36108 bytes, page
// echoes the alias but hits no DB), so no rows leak. Structural,
// not sensitive; leaks the moment the page grows a server-side
// fetch that uses its own credentials.
//
// The enumeration IS the contract: if you add a new page route
// with a dynamic child, add its :path* variant to proxy.ts AND
// add a representative case to CASES here.
//
// Uses playwright.request.newContext (no browser, no cookie state).
// maxRedirects:0 so we see the 307 directly instead of following it.
